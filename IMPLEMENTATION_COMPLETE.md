# Implementation Complete - n8n Workflow Ready

## âœ… What Was Implemented

### 1. n8n Workflow File Created
**Location:** `C:\Users\robeo\Documents\squarepicks\n8n-firestore-update-workflow.json`

**Workflow Name:** "Firestore Team Enrichment and Game Remapping"

**What it does:**
- Enriches 31 old NFL team documents with ESPN IDs and abbreviations
- Remaps 13 game documents to use correct team references
- Eliminates need for manual Firebase Console updates

**Workflow Structure:**
```
1. Manual Trigger (you click "Execute")
2. Set Teams Data (31 teams with ESPN IDs)
3. Split Out Teams (convert to individual items)
4. Firestore Upsert Team (update each team: add externalIds.espn, abbrev, sport)
5. Set Games Data (13 games with team mappings)
6. Split Out Games (convert to individual items)
7. Build Team Refs (create Firestore reference objects)
8. Firestore Upsert Game (update awayTeam/homeTeam refs)
```

### 2. Setup Guide Created
**Location:** `C:\Users\robeo\Documents\squarepicks\N8N_WORKFLOW_SETUP.md`

**Contains:**
- Step-by-step credential configuration
- Workflow import instructions
- Execution guide
- Verification steps
- Troubleshooting tips

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Your Action Required)

### Step 1: No Credential Setup Needed! âœ…

**Good news:** The workflow uses your existing OAuth2 credential from "Firestore Manager" workflow.

- **Credential:** "Google Firebase Cloud Firestore account 2"
- **Already configured:** âœ…
- **Skip to Step 2!**

### Step 2: Import Workflow (2 minutes)

1. In n8n: **Workflows** â†’ **Add workflow** â†’ **Import from File**
2. Select: `C:\Users\robeo\Documents\squarepicks\n8n-firestore-update-workflow.json`
3. Click **Import**

### Step 3: Verify & Execute (1 minute)

1. Open the imported workflow
2. Credentials are already linked automatically âœ…
3. Click **Save** (top right)
4. Click **Execute Workflow** (top right)

### Step 4: Verify Results (2 minutes)

**Check Firestore:**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/square-picks-vpbb8d/firestore/data/~2Fteams/RDnjryTT2mkizKSm9ikl
2. Verify new fields: `externalIds.espn: "33"`, `abbrev: "BAL"`, `sport: "NFL"`

**Check Frontend:**
1. Visit: https://squarepicks.com/lobby?sport=NFL
2. Verify team logos appear correctly
3. Check Monday night game (BUF @ ATL) shows correct logos

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After workflow execution:

âœ… **31 teams enriched** with:
- `externalIds.espn` (ESPN team ID)
- `abbrev` (team abbreviation like "BAL", "KC", etc.)
- `sport: "NFL"`

âœ… **13 games remapped** with:
- `awayTeam` reference pointing to old team doc
- `homeTeam` reference pointing to old team doc

âœ… **Team logos display** on frontend:
- Storage URLs (your custom logos)
- No broken images
- No ESPN CDN URLs

âœ… **Future ingests work correctly:**
- `findTeamByEspn` function queries by `externalIds.espn`
- Finds existing teams instead of creating duplicates
- No new duplicate teams created

## ðŸ“Š Data Summary

**Teams to Enrich:** 31 NFL teams
- Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers, New England Patriots, Denver Broncos, etc.
- Each gets ESPN ID (1-34), abbreviation (BAL, CAR, NE, etc.), and sport flag

**Games to Remap:** 13 games
- Week 6 NFL games (401772634, 401772748, etc.)
- Includes Monday Night (BUF @ ATL) and Sunday Night (DET @ KC)

**Duplicate Teams Deleted:** 30 teams (already completed)
- ESPN-logo versions removed
- Storage-logo versions kept

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

**Firestore Operations:**
- Operation type: `upsert` (create or update)
- Team updates: Merge new fields into existing docs
- Game updates: Replace team reference fields

**Authentication:**
- Method: Google Service Account
- File: `certificates/firebase-admin-key.json`
- Permissions: Firestore write access

**n8n Node Types Used:**
- Manual Trigger (start workflow)
- Set (static data)
- Split Out (array to items)
- Code (JavaScript for references)
- Google Cloud Firestore (database operations)

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **One-Time Execution:** This workflow only needs to run once
2. **No Rollback for Deletes:** 30 duplicate teams were already deleted (irreversible)
3. **Safe to Re-run:** Upsert operations are idempotent (can run multiple times)
4. **Execution Time:** ~30-60 seconds for 44 total operations
5. **After Success:** Disable or delete the workflow (no longer needed)

## âœ¨ What Happens After This

1. **Logos display correctly** - Storage URLs render in `next/image`
2. **No copyright issues** - Using your custom logos, not ESPN's
3. **Future ingests work** - `findTeamByEspn` finds teams by ESPN ID
4. **No duplicate teams** - Function throws error if team not found
5. **Clean database** - All team references point to correct docs

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

**If workflow fails:**
- Check `N8N_WORKFLOW_SETUP.md` Troubleshooting section
- Verify credential has Firestore write permissions
- Check n8n execution logs for specific error

**If you prefer manual approach:**
- Follow `FIREBASE_CONSOLE_STEPS.md` instead
- Manual updates via Firebase Console (~20 minutes)

**Still stuck?**
- n8n execution history shows exactly what was written
- Can manually revert via Firebase Console using execution logs
