*   [ ] **State Registration/Bonding:** Check current state requirements for sweepstakes registration and bonding based on prize value. Complete any necessary filings *before* the promotion starts. ([Link to State Law Resource/Legal Guidance])
*   [ ] **Marketing Materials:** Review all promotional materials (in-app messages, emails, ads) for accuracy, clarity, and compliance with rules (especially "No Purchase Necessary" disclosures, eligibility, dates). Ensure "Square Up." tagline usage aligns with brand guidelines.
*   [ ] **Technical Setup:** Confirm the board setup, square selection limits, payment processing for entries, and data capture mechanisms are functioning correctly.
