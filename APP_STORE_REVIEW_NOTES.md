# SquarePicks - App Store Review Notes: Sweepstakes Compliance Summary

**App Name:** SquarePicks
**Company:** SquarePicks LLC

**Subject:** Compliance Information for App Review Teams regarding Sweepstakes Mechanics

This document provides a summary to assist App Store review teams in understanding that SquarePicks operates as a legal promotional sweepstakes in the United States, compliant with relevant laws, and is **not** a gambling application.

**1. Nature of the App:**
SquarePicks offers contests based on predicting the final digits of scores in real-world sporting events using a 10x10 grid format.

**2. Sweepstakes Model (Prize, Chance, NO Consideration):**
*   **Prize:** Winners receive cash prizes credited to their in-app account balance, based on contest rules.
*   **Chance:** Winners are determined by *chance*, based on matching randomly assigned grid numbers (assigned *after* the board closes) to the last digits of official game scores at specific intervals (e.g., end of quarters, final score). User skill does not influence the outcome.
*   **No Consideration Required (No Purchase Necessary):**
    *   Participation does **not** require a purchase.
    *   A **Free Alternative Method of Entry (AMOE)** is prominently available within the app, granting users one (1) free entry each week into a designated featured contest, as detailed in our Terms and How to Play guide.
    *   Free entries have the exact same chance of winning as paid entries.

**3. Distinction from Gambling/Lottery:**
Because a free method of entry (AMOE) is always available and winner determination involves chance based on external events combined with random number assignment (not user skill in predicting scores), SquarePicks contests meet the legal definition of a promotional sweepstakes and are distinct from illegal lotteries or gambling.

**4. Compliance Measures:**
*   The app employs geolocation technology to restrict participation to users physically located in US states where such sweepstakes are legally permitted.
*   Age verification (21+) is enforced.
*   Detailed rules, terms, and policies are available within the app.

**Conclusion:**
SquarePicks is structured to comply with US sweepstakes laws. The clear availability of a free entry method ensures no purchase is necessary to participate or win.
