    -   "Log In" and "View Lobby" buttons at top-right; buttons are fully clickable with appropriate z-index and `pointer-events`.
-   **Calls to Action:**
    -   Primary: "Get Started" â†’ `/signup/email`.
    -   Secondary: "How It Works" scrolls to the How to Play section with Edge-friendly fallback.

    -   Four-step overview with icons; animated on view.
-   **Footer CTA:**
    -   Copy: "Sign up today and claim your free weekly sweepstakes square" with a Sign Up button.
