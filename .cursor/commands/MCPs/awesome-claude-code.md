# Rule: awesome-claude-code Usage

## 1. Primary Directive
Before creating hooks/commands/workflows for Claude Code, consult the awesome-claude-code MCP and reuse vetted resources.

## 2. Planning Phase
1. Identify need: hooks, slash-commands, tooling, IDE integration.
2. Search the docs (`search_awesome_claude_docs`) with a precise query (e.g., "hooks", "release command").
3. Fetch details (`fetch_awesome_claude_docs` or `fetch_generic_url_content`) and confirm license.

## 3. Implementation Phase
1. Prefer lightweight adoption (copy command files or install minimal tooling).
2. For hooks, follow the linked repoâ€™s setup exactly (no local deviations).
3. Document adopted resources and links in the PR/issue.
