# Story: Architecture Sync via BMAD

## Goal
Validate our current architecture against BMAD core-architecture and capture deltas.

## Tasks
- Use BMAD MCP: `search_BMAD_METHOD_documentation` for "core architecture" then fetch.
- Extract sections: agents/teams, templates/tasks/checklists/data, web-builder usage.
- Compare to our `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `src/app` structure.
- Propose follow-ups as stories.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Diff summary with links to BMAD sources.
- Concrete follow-up story list.
