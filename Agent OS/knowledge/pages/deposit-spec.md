# PayPal Deposit Integration Specification

## Overview
Implement missing PayPal SDK integration to complete the deposit flow as documented in wallet-flow.md. The current implementation only creates orders but lacks actual payment processing.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Firebase Cloud Functions exist (`createPayPalOrder`, `capturePayPalOrder`)
- ✅ PayPal dependencies installed (`@paypal/react-paypal-js`)
- ✅ Basic form validation and order creation
- ❌ PayPal buttons not rendered
- ❌ Payment approval flow missing
- ❌ Order capture integration incomplete
- ❌ Transaction feedback missing

## Required Capabilities

### 1. PayPal SDK Integration
- Render PayPal buttons with proper styling
- Handle PayPal script loading and initialization
- Implement PayPal provider wrapper

### 2. Payment Flow Completion
- Connect order creation to PayPal approval
- Implement `onPayPalApprove` callback
- Add order capture via Firebase function
- Handle payment success/failure states

### 3. User Experience
- Add loading states during payment processing
- Implement proper error handling and retry
- Show transaction completion feedback
- Redirect to wallet after successful deposit

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
1. **PayPal Provider Setup**
   - Add PayPalScriptProvider to app layout
   - Configure PayPal client ID and environment

2. **Deposit Page Updates**
   - Replace form submission with PayPal buttons
   - Add PayPal button event handlers
   - Implement payment flow state management

3. **State Management**
   - Add payment processing states
   - Handle PayPal approval/cancellation
   - Manage order creation and capture flow

### Backend Integration
1. **Firebase Function Calls**
   - `createPayPalOrder` for initial order creation
   - `capturePayPalOrder` for payment completion
   - Error handling and retry logic

2. **Transaction Recording**
   - Update user wallet balance
   - Create transaction records
   - Send notifications

## Success Criteria
- Users can complete PayPal deposits end-to-end
- Payment flow matches documented wallet-flow.md
- Error handling covers all failure scenarios
- Transaction recording works correctly
- UI provides clear feedback throughout process

## Testing Requirements
- PayPal sandbox integration
- Firebase function validation
- Error scenario coverage
- Transaction recording verification
- Cross-browser compatibility
