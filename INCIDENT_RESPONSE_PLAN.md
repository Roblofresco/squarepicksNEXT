*   **Technical Lead:** [Name/Role] - Leads technical investigation and resolution.
*   **Communications Lead:** [Name/Role, e.g., Support Lead, Marketing Manager] - Manages internal and external communications.

## 2. Incident Identification & Classification

**A. Detection:** Incidents may be detected through:
*   Automated monitoring alerts (system performance, security logs, error rates)
*   User reports (via support channels)
*   Internal staff observation
*   Third-party notifications (e.g., payment processor issues)

**B. Initial Assessment & Triage:**
*   The first responder (often Tech Lead or Support) performs a quick assessment:
    *   What is the nature of the incident (outage, breach, performance issue)?
    *   What systems/services are affected?
    *   What is the potential impact (user data, financial transactions, reputation)?
*   Notify the Incident Commander (IC).

**C. Classification (Example Levels - Customize as needed):**
*   **Level 1 (Critical):** Major outage, confirmed data breach affecting sensitive user info (PII, financial), significant financial loss.
*   **Level 2 (High):** Partial service disruption, potential data exposure (less sensitive), suspected security intrusion.
*   **Level 3 (Medium):** Performance degradation, minor feature malfunction, localized issues.
*   **Level 4 (Low):** Minor bugs, isolated user issues, informational alerts.

The IC confirms the classification, which dictates the response urgency and resources allocated.

## 3. Response Procedures (General Steps - Adapt based on Incident Type)

**A. Containment:**
*   **Goal:** Stop the bleeding. Limit the scope and impact of the incident.
*   **Actions (Examples):** Isolate affected systems, disable compromised accounts, block malicious IP addresses, temporarily disable features, backup critical data.
*   Technical Lead directs containment efforts.

**B. Eradication:**
*   **Goal:** Remove the root cause of the incident.
*   **Actions (Examples):** Patch vulnerabilities, remove malware, fix faulty code, restore clean data from backups, reset compromised credentials.
*   Technical Lead directs eradication efforts.

**C. Recovery:**
*   **Goal:** Restore affected systems and services to normal operation.
*   **Actions (Examples):** Bring systems back online, verify functionality, monitor performance closely, implement enhanced monitoring.
*   Technical Lead confirms recovery.

**D. Communication:**
*   **Internal:** IC keeps relevant internal stakeholders informed (via [Specify Channel: Slack, Email List]).
*   **External (Users):** Communications Lead drafts and disseminates user notifications (via in-app message, email, status page) as appropriate for the incident level and impact. Focus on transparency without causing undue panic. Use pre-approved templates where possible. Coordinate with Legal/Compliance on breach notifications.
*   **Third Parties:** Notify payment processors, hosting providers, etc., if relevant.

**E. Legal & Compliance:**
*   Compliance/Legal Liaison assesses notification requirements (data breach laws, regulatory bodies).
*   Engage legal counsel for significant incidents (especially data breaches).
*   Preserve evidence (logs, system images) for investigation and potential legal action.

## 4. Post-Incident Activities

**A. Post-Mortem Meeting:**
*   Held within [Specify Timeframe, e.g., 48 hours] of incident resolution for Level 1 & 2 incidents.
*   Participants: IC, Tech Lead, Comms Lead, Compliance, key responders.
*   **Agenda:**
    *   Timeline of events
    *   Root cause analysis
    *   What went well?
    *   What could be improved?
    *   Action items for prevention/improvement.

**B. Documentation & Reporting:**
*   Create a detailed incident report documenting the timeline, actions taken, root cause, impact, and lessons learned.
*   Track completion of action items from the post-mortem.

**C. Plan Updates:**
*   Update this Incident Response Plan based on lessons learned.
*   Update related documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, monitoring configurations, etc.).

---

## 5. Plan Testing & Maintenance

*   Conduct tabletop exercises or simulations [Specify Frequency, e.g., Annually] to test the plan's effectiveness.
*   Review and update this plan [Specify Frequency, e.g., Annually] or after significant system changes or incidents.
