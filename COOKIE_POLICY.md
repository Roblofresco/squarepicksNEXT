# Cookie Policy for SquarePicks

**Last Updated:** 4/10/2025

This Cookie Policy explains how SquarePicks LLC ("Company", "we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit our website or use the SquarePicks mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Service"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

Please read this Cookie Policy in conjunction with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## 1. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use an app. Cookies are widely used by online service providers to make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website or app owner (in this case, SquarePicks LLC) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the service (e.g., analytics, advertising, interactive content).

## 2. Why Do We Use Cookies?

We use first-party and potentially third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our Service to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Service, such as remembering preferences or analyzing usage patterns. We categorize these as follows:

*   **Strictly Necessary Cookies:** These are essential for you to navigate the Service and use its core features, such as accessing secure areas, managing your account session, and ensuring security. The Service cannot function properly without these cookies.
*   **Performance and Analytics Cookies:** These cookies collect information about how you use our Service, like which pages you visit most often and if you receive error messages. This data helps us improve how the Service works. We may use third-party analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics) for this purpose.
*   **Functionality Cookies:** These cookies allow the Service to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or region) and provide enhanced, more personal features. They may be used to remember layout preferences or accessibility settings.
*   **Geolocation Cookies/Technologies:** We use technologies to determine your physical location when you access the Service. This is strictly necessary to comply with laws and our Terms & Conditions, ensuring that you are accessing the Service from an eligible jurisdiction. This may involve using your IP address or other device signals. Precise geolocation data is collected only with your explicit permission if required by the operating system.
*   **Targeting or Advertising Cookies:** *(Placeholder: SquarePicks LLC currently does *not* use cookies for targeted advertising purposes. Adjust if needed.)*

## 3. Types of Cookies Used

We may use the following types of cookies:

*   **Session Cookies:** These are temporary cookies that expire once you close your browser or app.
*   **Persistent Cookies:** These remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them. They are used to remember your preferences for future visits.

*(Placeholder: A detailed list of specific cookies requires a technical audit.)*

## 4. Other Tracking Technologies

In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs") or local storage. These are often used in conjunction with cookies to help us understand user activity, deliver cookies, or track website usage.

## 5. Your Choices Regarding Cookies

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject certain cookies.

*   **Cookie Consent Banner/Tool:** When you first visit our Service, you may be presented with a banner or tool allowing you to manage your preferences for non-essential cookies.
*   **Browser Settings:** Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. You can set your browser to refuse cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you disable strictly necessary cookies, some parts of our Service may not function properly.
*   **Third-Party Analytics:** To opt-out of analytics cookies provided by specific third parties (like Google Analytics), you may need to visit their respective opt-out pages.

*(Placeholder: Provide specific links or instructions for any consent tool used.)*

## 6. Changes to This Cookie Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
