## 4. Tone and Language

*   **Opening:** "Hi [User Name], thanks for contacting SquarePicks support!"

*   **Apology (if applicable):** "I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused." or "Sorry to hear you're having trouble with that."
*   **Avoid:** Blame, technical jargon (unless necessary and explained), definitive promises you can't keep (e.g., "This will be fixed tomorrow.").
*   **Use:** "SquarePicks" (not "we" sometimes), "Square Up." tagline where appropriate and natural.
